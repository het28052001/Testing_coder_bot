# Project Title

## Description

This project is designed to demonstrate how to set up a Python virtual environment and run a Streamlit application.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   This command creates a new virtual environment named `venv`. A virtual environment is a self-contained directory that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, plus several additional packages.
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**
   This command activates the virtual environment. Once activated, any Python or pip commands will use the versions in the virtual environment instead of the global Python installation.
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**
   This command installs all the necessary packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file. These packages are essential for the application to run properly.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Streamlit Application**
   This command starts the Streamlit application by running the `main.py` file. Streamlit will open a new tab in your web browser to display the application interface.
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

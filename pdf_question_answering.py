The original code is a Streamlit application for PDF and text file question answering using OpenAI, while the new code is a React component for a dashboard configuration with input fields for GitHub URL, access token, and username. Since the functionalities of the new file do not integrate with the original code and are unrelated to its purpose, no changes are necessary to the original code.

Here is the original code as it is:

import streamlit as st
import PyPDF2
import openai
import os

def load_pdf(file):
    pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(file)
    text = ""
    for page in pdf_reader.pages:
        text += page.extract_text()
    return text

def load_text(file):
    text = file.read().decode("utf-8")
    return text

def query_openai(prompt):
    openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message['content']

st.title("PDF and Text File Question Answering with OpenAI")

uploaded_file = st.sidebar.file_uploader("Choose a PDF or text file", type=["pdf", "txt"])

if uploaded_file is not None:
    if uploaded_file.type == "application/pdf":
        pdf_text = load_pdf(uploaded_file)
        st.write("Document Content:", pdf_text)
    elif uploaded_file.type == "text/plain":
        text_content = load_text(uploaded_file)
        st.write("Document Content:", text_content)

    question = st.text_input("Ask a question about the document content:")
    
    if st.button("Get Answer"):
        if question:
            if uploaded_file.type == "application/pdf":
                answer = query_openai(f"{pdf_text}\n\nQuestion: {question}")
            elif uploaded_file.type == "text/plain":
                answer = query_openai(f"{text_content}\n\nQuestion: {question}")
            st.write("Answer:", answer)
        else:
            st.warning("Please enter a question.")
